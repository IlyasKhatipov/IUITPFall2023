A. String Replacement Problem

inputinput.txt
outputoutput.txt
You will be given a string S
 and an array A
. For each integer i
 in A
, you need to replace the i
-th character of S
 with the i
-th character of the English language (lowercase).

For example, given string "thisismy" and the array {1, 5, 7}, you need to replace the character with index 1 in S
 with character "a", the character with index 5 with "e", and the character with the index 7 with "g". The result of the previous example is "taisiemg".

Rules for valid input are as follows:

S
 will consist of lowercase English letters, uppercase English letters, digits, and the symbols "()*!@#$%&^" (quotation marks not included in the set of valid symbols). The values in A
 are distinct, the maximum value in A
 is less than the length of S
. No values in A
 will be bigger than 26 or smaller than 1.

You will receive an input in the same format dictated by input.txt, if the input does not follow the rules above (e.g. values in A
 not distinct, values in A
 bigger than 26, etc.) you only need to print "Invalid inputs". Otherwise, solve the problem as mentioned in the problem statement.

Length of S
, denoted as N
, should be in the range [2, 50]. Length of A
, denoted as M
, should be in the range [1, min(N−1,26)
]. If you receive an input where N
 or M
 are out of bounds (e.g. N=−1
, N=100
, M>min(N−1,26)
) you only need to print "Invalid inputs".

In summary, the cases of "Invalid inputs" are: N
 out of bounds, M
 out of bounds, S
 has characters unspecified by the rules, values in A
 are not distinct, maximum value in A
 is bigger than or equal to N
, a value in A
 is bigger than 26 or smaller than 1, or any other issues.

The length of S
 will always match with N
 unless N
 is out of bounds. The length of A
 will always match with M
 unless M
 is out of bounds.

Input
input.txt:

First line- an integer N
 (2 ≤ N
 ≤ 50).
Second line- a string S
 which consists of N
 characters unless N
 is out of bounds.
Third line- an integer M
 (1 ≤ M
 ≤ min
(N
 - 1, 26)).
Fourth line- M
 integers unless M
 is out of bounds.
Each input file ends with a new line character.
Output
The output should be written to output.txt and should contain the following:

First line- a string of the output as dictated by the problem statement or "Invalid inputs".

Note
You need to print a newline character "\n" after your output. E.g: if the solution is "Invalid inputs" then you should print "Invalid inputs\n".

You will be reading and writing from files, not standard input/output.
